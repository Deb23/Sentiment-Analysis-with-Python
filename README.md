# Supervised Sentiment-Analysis-with-Python
A first try at scrapping comments from a public facebook posts and running a basic Naive Bayes Classifier on them to analyze the sentiment. The model is trained using the pre labeled movie review corpus. The code classifies comments as either "Positive" or "Negative". Working on improving the accuracy/methodology of the code.
